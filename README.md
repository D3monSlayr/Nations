# FAQ
## You might be wondering why I haven't published a release yet?
It's because error messages have to be correctly indicated especially
with a large codebase like that.

## What are your plans for this plugin?
This will be the **Lite** version of the plugin with the basic stuff but
soon, there will be a **Pro** version, featuring new GUIs, commands, and
overall improvement in code. There will be two branches dedicated to both
versions later.

- There will be an official release when I finish with the Lite version.
- Also a discord will be released as the plugin grows in popularity.
